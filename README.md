**Hey Duck 🦆-**

I am a full stack developer, with a passion for beautiful front end design. Design that is accessible and designed with the user in mind. 
I am a School Of Code 🎓 (Cohort 15) bootcamper, working on various different team projects, while learning and building my tech stack!
Here are some of the things we built!
- 🍋https://github.com/melvinJD/bc15-w8-projects_week-the_byte_stripes-frontend A midterm project where we solved bootcamper networking issues, that allowed events and meetups to be organised within a simple app.
- 🍋 https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/project-pineapples A Next.js learning based website that demonstrates the capabilties of Next.js


## You can me find here…when I'm not in the garden 🍋
